Skybrud.Essentials is a library with common purpose functionality for working with .NET.

The package has a strong focus on parsing various types of input. Among other things, the package can help you work with date and time beyond the standard `DateTime` and `DateTimeOffset` classes in .NET. It has better support for various date formats - such as unix time, ISO 8601, RFC 822 and RFC 2822.

It also contains utilities for converting to and from string values, changing text casing and working with both JSON and XML.
