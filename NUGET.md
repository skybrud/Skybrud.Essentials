Skybrud.Essentials is a library with common purpose functionality for working with .NET.

The package can help you work with date and time beyond the standard `DateTime` and `DateTimeOffset` classes in .NET. It has better support for various date formats - such as unix time, ISO 8601, RFC 822 and RFC 2822.

It also contains utilities for converting string values, changing text casing and working with both JSON and XML.
